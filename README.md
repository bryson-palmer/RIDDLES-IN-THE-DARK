__________________________
## Introduction
My name is **Bryson Palmer** and I'm a student web developer. I'm currently in a *full stack* web developer bootcamp through the *University of Washington* under *Trilogy Education Services*. I'm looking to get into web development for my professional work. I plan on being a capable, creative, team oriented developer by the end of this program. I look forward to implementing this new skill in future employment.

## My Task
As a coding bootcamp student, I want to take a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores. And what better theme, than the interaction between Bilbo and Gollum. It's classic! I actually learned a lot from this assignment. I discovered the Fisher-Yates shuffle and the sorting method. Not to mention all the time with vanilla javasript and css. This is my first project linking other html or script files together and using the technique of hide and display elements.
